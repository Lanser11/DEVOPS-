DevOps, a portmanteau of "development" and "operations," represents a transformative approach to software development and IT operations. It emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between software developers and IT operations teams, aiming to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. In the DevOps culture, automation plays a crucial role in streamlining processes, from code development and testing to deployment and infrastructure management. By breaking down silos between teams and fostering a culture of shared responsibility, DevOps enables organizations to achieve faster deployment times, improved reliability, and enhanced scalability, ultimately driving greater efficiency and innovation in the software delivery pipeline.
